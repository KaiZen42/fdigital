	"email": "hope you had a good weekend! Thanks for meeting me today, I have a new task for you this week. Our consulting firm has a new client to advise called Gamindo. They are a fast growing-company that leverages interactive marketing and believes in the power of gaming to get consumers and employeesâ€™ attention and affection. They are betting on video game as the new frontier of marketing. Throughout impact branded web-based video games, they allow companies to have a return in terms of engagement, lead generation, data collection & insight, education, drive-to-store and brand reputation. They make branded web video games in order to make effective, fun and impactful the interactions between brands & consumers and company & employees. In particular, their business model is characterized by circularity: A company chooses gamindoâ€™s games to promote itself, and gamindo creates a video game on the basis of the company products and services The company decides a budget to invest for donation and this money is converted into virtual coins that has to be earned by playing to the game, Users play and collect these coins interacting with the game, Then also users choose a not-for-profit organization or cause to which they desire to donate the coins earned, When the project is completed, Gamido makes the donation to the charity chosen by users and the company has a return in terms of brand awareness and corporate social responsibility. The benefit is three-fold: people, users, donate by having fun without spending, brands get promoted and do CSR, social causes get promotion and funds. Gamindo has selected us for a consulting job, since now they want to explore other markets apart from the italian one in which they have already been active with important brands like Barilla, Google, Coca-cola, L`Oreal, Unesco and Accenture just to name some. They are interested in getting our opinion on whether it is a good idea to internationalize the business. In order to advise them, you have to conduct an in-depth analysis of purposefull businesses by looking at some documents and video files we have already collected and stored in the library section. After having deepened your understanding of such types of businesses, I ask you to interview the owners of Gamindo with whom we have an appointment later. Try to understand if going international is a doable option for them, by asking a set of questions. You can choose within 10 sets of 3 questions each. From each set of 3 questions, you can select and ask Gamindo owners JUST ONE QUESTION. At the end of the interview you will have 10 answers from the owners; be sure you ask what is more relevant and interesting from your point of view, in order to provide them with advice.At the end of the interview please revise the short report I have prepared to summarize the important points and aspects involved in the decision to open to international markets. You will find a list of statements, and you will have to indicate whether each statement is true or false on the basis of the information you have gained through library material and Gamindo interview. If you find any false statements, please correct them. Thank you again for your collaboration. I am very confident you will provide a great piece of advice!",

	"email": "How are you doing? This week will be about the Flexibility value as it is reflected in consumers and firms choices;  activities will replicate the ones of last week. Please call me and engage in self-reflection with the flexible consumption scale. At the end of each item and scale, you will get a color on the screen, showing how you performed with respect to the mean of the scale. If you get a green screen, it means that you overperformed with respect to scale mean (your results are above the scale mean). If you get a yellow screen, it means that you scored exactly the scale mean. If you get a red screen, it means that you underperformed with respect to scale mean (your results are below the scale mean). Then, engage in a business game simulation about this weekâ€™s topic. Follow the instructions listed in HOME and find out more. Thank you and see you soon,",
