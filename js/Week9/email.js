	"email": "Thanks for picking up my call. I have another pretty important job for you for a new client of how venture capital firm. This client is called MIRTA, an online retailer distributing luxury fashion craft products worldwide. It was launched in 2019 as a B2C platform to connect Italian artisans with international end customers, allowing artisans to gain visibility and reach end customers directly. Access to the platform and its services is free for artisans. MIRTA in fact bases its business model on earning a percentage on products sold based on the services offered to the artisan. These services consist of product selection, product shooting and upload photos on the website, the creation of a page dedicated to each artisan in which photos and videos portray the companyâ€™s story, etc. While working on this business model, MIRTA realized that there was also an opportunity on the B2B side. In October 2021, it launched a second platform, MIRTA wholesale, with which MIRTA connects artisans with independent boutiques, who are increasingly looking for unique products to bring into their stores and customer base. A digital service allowing store owners to discover artisans and get them into communities without physically coming to Italy. MIRTA wants to quickly scale up the B2B market while sustainably growing also the B2C platform to create a new ecosystem in the world of luxury. In particular, one of MIRTAâ€™s main goals is to double the artisan base to over 2500 artisan by next year. This goal requires the growth of the team, to support all the players in the ecosystem: artisans, boutiques, and end consumers. And then, MIRTA will make investments in technology, since the company needs a solid technological component linked to process automation. MIRTA is looking for funds to scale up and it wants us to support this process financially and also providing managerial advice. The managerial challenge here is to win and successfully overcome a tension in its identity and business model, between scaling up the business and not distorting its more authentic nature of being close to traditional products and craftsmen. Our advice lies in a multidimensional approach, acting on several dimensions of such tension: identifying the contradictions and delivering specific solutions and actions at a micro, meso and macro level. In particular, for the micro tension we refer to the individual tension experienced by the single artisan - in balancing between tradition and innovation; and in addressing the role of technology in different 'moments' of the finished product. The meso level is represented by the portfolio of craftsmen to be involved and included in MIRTAâ€™s platform, depending on product types. Here, there is a theme of product categories and their relationship with technology (leather goods is different from furniture). The macro level instead refers to move beyond made in Italy. There is a matter of choice and inclusion of various 'made in' and various declinations of typicality in the platform. We have decided to invest in MIRTA and we suggest a multidimensional approach You should please revise our decision to invest in this brand. We want to make sure this is the right choice for us. Please interview the owners of MIRTA with whom we have arranged an appointment later for an online meeting. Try to understand if it is worth investing part of our budget in this business and if there is the chance of successfully overcoming the tension I previously mentioned. You will have the chance to directly ask them questions. You can choose within 10 sets of 3 questions each. From each set of 3 questions, you can select and ask MIRTA owners JUST ONE QUESTION. At the end of the interview you will have 10 answers from the owners; be sure you ask what is more relevant and interesting from your point of view, in order to revise our investment decision and managerial advice. At the end of the interview, please revise the report I have prepared to summarize the important aspects involved in the investment decision. You will find a list of statements, and you will have to indicate whether each statement is true or false on the basis of the information you have gained through MIRTAâ€™s interview. If you find any false statements, please correct them. That is all for now! Thank you for your precious help,",

If you get a green screen, it means that you overperformed with respect to scale mean (your results are above the scale mean).
