	"email": "Hope you are doing fine. Thanks for meeting me today, I was looking for you since I need your help on a task. Our consulting firm is advising the luxury fashion brand, Lâ€™MANE, from Dubai, I bet you have already heard about themâ€¦ we have to advise the owners on whether fashion rental for luxury items is a good business or not. We are pretty confident they should try this kind of business, however, we need to make sure our arguments in favour of such a choice are strong enough. In order to do so, you have to conduct an in-depth analysis of fashion rental businesses by looking at some documents and video files we have already collected and stored in the library section. Try to focus mainly on the pros and cons of fashion rental, aiming to understand whether is feasible and advantageous for Lâ€™MANE or not. After having deepened this aspect, I ask you to interview the owners of Lâ€™MANE with whom we have an appointment later. Try to understand if fashion rental is a doable option for them, by asking a set of questions.  You can choose within 10 sets of 3 questions each. From each set of 3 questions, you can select and ask Lâ€™MANE owners JUST ONE QUESTION. At the end of the interview you will have 10 answers from the owners; be sure you ask what is more relevant and interesting from your point of view, in order to provide them with advice. At the end of the interview please revise the short report I have prepared to summarize the important points and aspects involved in the decision to try fashion rental. You will find a list of statements, and you will have to indicate whether each statement is true or false on the basis of the information you have gained through library material and Lâ€™MANE interview. If you find any false statements, please correct them. Thank you again for your collaboration. I am very confident you will provide a great piece of advice!",

	"email": "How are you doing? This week will be about the Flexibility value as it is reflected in consumers and firms choices;  activities will replicate the ones of last week. Please call me and engage in self-reflection with the flexible consumption scale. At the end of each item and scale, you will get a color on the screen, showing how you performed with respect to the mean of the scale. If you get a green screen, it means that you overperformed with respect to scale mean (your results are above the scale mean). If you get a yellow screen, it means that you scored exactly the scale mean. If you get a red screen, it means that you underperformed with respect to scale mean (your results are below the scale mean). Then, engage in a business game simulation about this weekâ€™s topic. Follow the instructions listed in HOME and find out more.Thank you and see you soon,",
