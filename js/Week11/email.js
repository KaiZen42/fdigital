	"email": "I have a task for you today for a new client of our consulting firm. This client is called GREEN PEA, the world's first Green Retail Park devoted to the theme of Respect for the Planet and People. GREEN PEA was opened in Turin by the owners of the famous chain Eataly. GREEN PEA wants to design strategy to guide and orient customers in their shopping journey through the store. To do so, they want to know from our expert point of view what are relevant areas they need to investigate for defining such a strategy. The need is to create signposting and a value dictionary within the entire Green Pea store, with key words that accompany both the less attentive consumer to discover sustainable products, and to the already expert target. Then they want to make the in-store and online signposting system coherent, and design its impact on Green Pea's digital and social channels. I have already prepared a report isolating the most important areas to investigate for defining a strategy to orient consumers in their shopping journey. You should please revise this report and so, our advice. Please interview the owners of GREEN PEA. They have agreed to meet us to show the store environment and clarify their needs in a short online interview. Try to understand if the areas to investigate you will find in the report are coherent with the strategy they have to design. In the interview, you will have the chance to directly ask them questions. You can choose within 10 sets of 3 questions each. From each set of 3 questions, you can select JUST ONE QUESTION. Be sure you ask what is more relevant and interesting from your point of view, in order to advice GREEN PEA. At the end of the interview, you will find my report with a list of statements, and you will have to indicate whether each statement is true or false on the basis of the information you have gained through GREEN PEAâ€™s interview. If you find any false statements, please correct them. That is all for now.",
