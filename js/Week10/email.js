	"email": "Nice to see you again, you have made a great effort last week. Good job! Today, I need your expertise on a potential client. Please pay attention to the following information I will provide to perform a task for us. Our venture capital firm this week has scheduled an online meeting to interview a new potential client: SHAMPORA. I donâ€™t know if you have ever had the chance to hear this brand, but basically it is a digital platform selling personalized solutions for hair care and color. Its value proposition is based on unique products crafted directly by consumers online developing their personalized formula on the bases of their hairâ€™ needs. This personalization is possible thanks to the primary role technology has in SHAMPORAâ€™s business model. Apart from the digital interface of the ecommerce, and the distribution advantages of being an online retailer, the great innovation of SHAMPORA is that technology is employed and embedded from productsâ€™ design and development. All SHAMPORA products for hair are developed through the application of an algorithm, that functions as follows: the end customer browsing SHAMPORAâ€™s website wants to get the best formula for his/her hair type and color. SHAMPORA asks the customer to create a personal Hair Profile, providing personal info to create an account and starting a process of questions and answers on hair type and style. Questions in the format of multiple-choice options to select, follow the steps of a professional consultation. SHAMPORA acts like a personal hair assistant dedicated to the customer and available 24/7, since it is all automated. On the basis of customerâ€™s answers and communicated needs, SHAMPORAâ€™s algorithm creates the tailor-made formula, selecting only the ingredients that best suit the hair and scalp needs. The dosage is customised just for the customer with natural ingredients. The result is a different unique product for each single customer. After the product is developed, SHAMPORA delivers it to customersâ€™ door with their own Hair Box, including all sorts of product types. It is a win win situation since the customer achieve his/her personal hair goals and has also the impression of receiving dedicated assistance and care. While SHAMPORA does not have to sustain any inventory costs or any other costs involved in unsold production. By this made-to-order production model, there is no waste in terms of material and financial resources. This makes SHAMPORA very sustainable. SHAMPORA wants us to support them in their effort to find also a physical touchpoint to gain contact and reach customers, in addition to its digital one which is the website in place. Please interview SHAMPORAâ€™s owners and try to understand if investing in such brand by aiding them to add a physical touchpoint is doable while keeping the great advantages of its personalized value proposition and technology oriented business. You will have the chance to directly ask them questions. You can choose within 10 sets of 3 questions each. From each set of 3 questions, you can select and ask SHAMPORA owners JUST ONE QUESTION. At the end of the interview you will have 10 answers from the owners; be sure you ask what is more relevant and interesting from your point of view, in order to revise our investment decision and managerial advice. At the end of the interview, please revise the report I have prepared to summarize the important aspects involved in the investment decision. You will find a list of statements, and you will have to indicate whether each statement is true or false on the basis of the information you have gained through SHAMPORAâ€™s interview. If you find any false statements, please correct them. All from me, I am sure you will do a great job also this time.",

Please call me and engage in self-reflection with the flexible consumption scale. At the end of each item and scale, you will get a color on the screen, showing how you performed with respect to the mean of the scale. If you get a green screen, it means that you overperformed with respect to scale mean (your results are above the scale mean). If you get a yellow screen, it means that you scored exactly the scale mean. If you get a red screen, it means that you underperformed with respect to scale mean (your results are below the scale mean). Then, engage in a business game simulation about this weekâ€™s topic. Follow the instructions listed in HOME and find out more. Thank you and see you soon,",
