	"email": "Hey there! Thanks for coming over on such short notice. I have a pretty important and urgent job for you. As you know our venture capital firm has decided to invest in a sustainable luxury fashion brand, called Lâ€™MANE. You should please revise our decision to invest in this brand. We want to make sure this is the right choice for us. Please conduct an in-depth analysis of sustainable businesses by looking at some documents and video files the marketing team has collected and stored in the library section. When reviewing this material, try to focus mainly on the pros and cons of investing in such brands, that combine luxury consumption with sustainability concerns: the aim is to understand whether they are sustainable also in a financial sense and whether it is beneficial to invest in them. After having deepened these aspects, I ask you to interview the owners of Lâ€™MANE with whom we have arranged an appointment later for an online meeting. Try to understand if it is worth investing part of our budget in this business. I'll briefly anticipate what business it is. Lâ€™MANE is a luxury fashion brand founded in Dubai in 2015 by designer Lina Mane. The uniqueness of the brand lies in the contemporary and elegant one-of-a-kind ready-to-wear pieces. The brand has two main sources of profit: on one side they directly sell the products they produce to the end consumer, on the other side instead, they rent some of the pieces for occasions, events and short periods of time. You will have the chance to directly ask them questions. You can choose within 10 sets of 3 questions each. From each set of 3 questions, you can select and ask Lâ€™MANE owners JUST ONE QUESTION. At the end of the interview you will have 10 answers from the owners; be sure you ask what is more relevant and interesting from your point of view, in order to revise our investment decision. At the end of the interview please revise the short report I have prepared to summarize the important points and aspects involved in the investment decision. You will find a list of statements, and you will have to indicate whether each statement is true or false on the basis of the information you have gained through library material and Lâ€™MANE interview. If you find any false statements, please correct them. That is all from me! Thank you for your help, I am sure you will do a great job!",

	"email": "Nice to have you here again!\nAs for last week, we will ask you to rate yourself on a scale linked to this weekâ€™s topics to experience them personally. At the end of each item and scale, you will get a color on the screen, showing how you performed with respect to the mean of the scale. If you get a green screen, it means that you overperformed with respect to scale mean (your results are above the scale mean). If you get a yellow screen, it means that you scored exactly the scale mean. If you get a red screen, it means that you underperformed with respect to scale mean (your results are below the scale mean).\n \nThe second part of this asynchronous session will engage you in a business game simulation. Follow the instructions listed in HOME and find out more.\nThank you for your attention,\nEnjoy your time with us!\nSimona\n",
