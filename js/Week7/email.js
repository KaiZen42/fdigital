	"email": "Thanks for meeting me. I have a task for you today. Our consulting firm is advising the start-up GAMINDO, on whether to expand their business internationally or not. We are pretty confident they should try to expand it and reach other countries, however, we need to make sure our arguments in favor of such choice are strong enough. You should please revise our decision. Please conduct an in-depth analysis of all those businesses built around a purpose by looking at some documents and video files we have already collected and stored in the library section. Try to focus mainly on the pros and cons of such a practice, aiming to understand whether is feasible and advantageous for GAMINDO to expand internationally. After having deepened this aspect, I ask you to interview the owners of GAMINDO with whom we have an appointment later. Try to understand if a start-up with such a purpose may also work abroad and if expanding is a doable option for them. At the end of the interview please revise the short report I have prepared to summarize the important points and aspects involved in the decision to expand internationally.",
